Wrap block of text with shortcode. It will be split into columns. Automagically.

== Description ==

I needed automated, tag-aware column splitter for one of my projects. So I have created one.

= Features =

*	fully automatic splitter;
*	tag-aware;
*	splits long paragraphs and unordered lists;
*	keeps text with headers;

= Requirements =

The plugin requires DOM API (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php) and Tidy (http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.tidy.php)

= Usage =

Wrap block of text with `[auto_columns]...[/auto_columns]` shortcode. It will produce markup like

	<div class="auto-columns-container columns-2">
	<div class="auto-columns-column column-1 first-column">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</div>
	<div class="auto-columns-column column-2 last-column">Nam tincidunt gravida dui, at bibendum nisl lacinia nec.</div>
	<div class="auto-columns-clear"></div>
	</div>

In your theme use `do_shortcode` function:

	<?php echo do_shortcode('[auto_columns]' . $content . '[/auto_columns]'); ?>

You will have to define width for `.auto-columns-column` class in your theme, of course.
